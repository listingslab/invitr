# Invite and track guests to events like weddings

## Isomorphic JavaScript Invitation Server

- A public site that is just static html, served with static-now. The site will do API calls back to the server for the content.
- An administration site for administration of the text content of the site. This will be based on my example koa example blog
- An API serving the content from use form the static site.

If you're promoting an event, these are the most important questions to answer.

1. Who? (it's always all about the people being first)
2. What? (what the people are doing)
3. When?
4. Where?
5. How?

## Technologies

Node.js, Koa.js, OpenShift, Git, npm,
